Download Abalone dataset. (URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)
Data set has total 8 Number of Attributes.
Sex nominal M, F, and I (infant)
 Length continuous mm Longest shell measurement
 Diameter continuous mm perpendicular to length
 Height continuous mm with meat in shell
 Whole weight continuous grams whole abalone
 Shucked weight continuous grams weight of meat
 Viscera weight continuous grams gut weight (after bleeding)
 Shell weight continuous grams after being dried
 Rings (age/class of abalone)
Load the data from data file and split it into training and test datasets. Summarize
the properties in the training dataset. The number of rings is the value to predict:
either as a continuous value or as a classification problem.
Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements using linear regression or
predict ring class as classification problem
